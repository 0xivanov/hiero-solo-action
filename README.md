# hedera-solo-action

A GitHub Action for setting up a Hedera Solo network.
The network contains one node that can be accessed at `localhost:50211`.

The action creates an account that contains 10,000,000 hbars.
All information about the account is stored as output to the github action.

## Inputs

The GitHub action takes the following inputs:

- `installMirrorNode`: A boolean parameter that is `false` by default.
  If set to `true`, the action will install a mirror node in addition to the main node.
  The mirror node can be accessed at `localhost:8080`.
- `installRelay`: A boolean parameter that is `false` by default.
  If set to `true`, the action will install the JSON-RPC-Relay as part of the setup process. This allows you to easily add a relay to your Hedera network setup. The relay is 
  installed using the `solo relay deploy` command.

| Input          | Description                    | Required | Default   |
|----------------|--------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| `installRelay` | Install JSON-RPC-Relay         | false    | false     |
| `hederaVersion`| Hedera network version to use  | false    | `v0.52.2` |   

- `hederaVersion`: An optional parameter to specify the Hedera version used in the setup.
  If not provided, the action defaults to the latest Mainnet version (v0.52.2).

## Outputs

The GitHub action outputs the following information:

- `accountId`: The account ID of the account created.
- `privateKey`: The private key of the account created.
- `publicKey`: The public key of the account created.

# Tributes

This action is based on the work of [Hedera Hashgraph](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services) and [Hedera Solo](https://github.com/hashgraph/solo).
Without the great help of [Timo](https://github.com/timo0), [Nathan](https://github.com/nathanklick), and [Lenin](https://github.com/leninmehedy) this action would not exist.
